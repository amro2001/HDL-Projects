## Digital Clock
    In this FPGA project, I implemented a digital clock using VHDL on the DE1-SoC board. The design features a 26-bit counter for seconds, 4-bit counters for minutes and hours, and utilizes a seven-segment display decoder for visual output. Users can interact with the clock through switches and keys to set time parameters, showcasing practical applications of digital design and FPGA programming principles
